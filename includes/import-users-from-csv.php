	Code to import sponsored member associations when using the Import Users From CSV plugin.
	
	Step 0. Have your $pmprosm_sponsored_account_levels global setup already with sponsored level relationships.
	
	Step 1. Add the following columns to your import CSV:
	* pmprosm_seats: This will set the user meta field that stores the number of seats available to a sponsoring/parent account. Leave blank or 0 for unlimited.
	* pmprosm_sponsor: set to the ID, user login, or email address of the sponsoring parent account and the relationship will be setup.
	
	IMPORTANT: Make sure that sponsors are imported BEFORE their child accounts. i.e. sponsors should come earlier/higher up in the CSV
